Stochastical methods in algebraic geometry

Real algebraic varieties are persistently difficult to analyze. In order to give a local understanding around one already know point, "Stochastical_Analysis" samples the varity locally and then tries to determine the dimension of a best approximating linear subspace and hence the dimension of the variety.
