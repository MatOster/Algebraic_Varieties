# Algebraic_Varieties
Stochastical methods in algebraic geometry and material science. First using PCA to analyze real algebraic varieties. Later using artificial neural networks to find some kind of representation of algebraic variety and analyze material properties form this representation.

Idea for PCA:
Use something like persistent PCA (as in Persistent Homology), i.e. make a stochastical analysis of the variety by changing the diameter of sample cloud and check how certain ratioas (for example of the eigenvalues) change with size of samples.
